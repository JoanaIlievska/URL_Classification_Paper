# URL_Classification_Paper

The findings from this study contribute to the growing 
body of research in the field of URL classification, providing 
insights into the effectiveness of transformer-based models, 
particularly RoBERTa, in handling diverse URL types. Future 
work can explore further refinements of the proposed model, 
investigate other transformer architectures, and consider 
additional features to enhance the performance and robustness 
of URL classification systems, ultimately strengthening the 
defense against emerging cyber threats.
